# Connecting to Redis from a PHP App

This example uses [predis](https://github.com/nrk/predis), installed with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).  Just run `composer install` in this directory.

## Connection String

The connection string provided by your Compose Redis deployment should go into the file `config.php` (created by copying `config.template.php`).
