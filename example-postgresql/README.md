# Connecting to PostgreSQL from a PHP App

This example uses PDO so you'll need this extension (included by default in PHP) and the postgres driver for it.

The connection string provided by your Compose PostgreSQL deployment should go into the file `config.php` (created by copying `config.template.php`).
