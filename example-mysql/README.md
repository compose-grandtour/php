# Connecting to MySQL from a PHP App

This example uses PDO (included with PHP by default) so you'll need the PDO extension and some MySQL support to use this example.

## Connection String

The connection string provided by your Compose MySQL deployment should go into the file `config.php` (created by copying `config.template.php`).
