# The Grand Tour - PHP

A set of example applications that will add word/definition pairs to a database running on Compose.

## Running the Example

To run from the command-line:

* Clone this repo to the root of your web server's document directory
* Navigate to the example-<_db_> directory
* Rename the file `example-<_db_>/env.template.php` to `example-<_db_>/env.php`
* In the file `example-<_db_>/env.php`, change the connection variables to match those of your Compose database instance.
* And then in your browser: `http://localhost/php/example-<_db_>/templates/index.html`

The application will be served on your localhost and can be opened in a browser.
