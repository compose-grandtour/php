# Connecting to RabbitMQ from a PHP App

This example uses [php-amqplib](https://packagist.org/packages/php-amqplib/php-amqplib), installed with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).  Just run `composer install` in this directory.

## Connection Details

The connection string provided by your Compose Redis deployment should go into the file `config.php` (created by copying `config.template.php`).
