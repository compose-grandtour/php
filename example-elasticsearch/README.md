# Connecting to ElasticSearch from a PHP App

This example uses the [elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-php) library, installed with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).  Just run `composer install` in this directory.

## Connection String

The connection string provided by your Compose ElasticSearch deployment should go into the file `config.php` (created by copying `config.template.php`).
